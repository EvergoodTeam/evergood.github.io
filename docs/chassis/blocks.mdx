As of `1.2.3`, this is outdated. Refer to [this test class](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Chassis/blob/1.19.2/src/main/java/evergoodteam/chassis/ChassisTestFeatures.java) instead for the time being.

### Creating your Block

Block objects can be created through the `BlockBase` class.  
You can customize your Block from the ground up using `FabricBlockSettings`, or use the available methods with specific parameters.

```java
public static final Block RUBY_ORE = new BlockBase(Material.STONE, 2.5f, 7.0f, BlockSoundGroup.STONE);
```

You may also provide a `List` to which add a Block as soon as its object is created. This can be useful to later register all your blocks, since you'll just have to cycle through its contents.

```java
public static final List<Block> BLOCKS = new ArrayList<>();

public static final Block RUBY_ORE = new BlockBase(BLOCKS, Material.STONE, 2.5f, 7.0f, BlockSoundGroup.STONE);
```

### ItemGroup

With this Block we can create an `ItemGroup`, a.k.a. a tab in the creative menu, to which you can add all your blocks and items.

To do so we can utilize the the `ItemGroupBase` class.

```java
public static final ItemGroup YOURMOD_GROUP = new ItemGroupBase("yourmodid", "itemgroup", RUBY_ORE).group;
```

### Registering

Registering is done with the `RegistryHandler` class.

Now we can register this Block and give it an Item form that player can hold in their inventory with `registerBlockAndItem()`.

```java
RegistryHandler.registerBlockAndItem("yourmodid", "ruby_ore", RUBY_ORE, YOURMOD_GROUP);
```

### Result

Your code should now look something like this:

```java title="MyMod.java"
public static final Block RUBY_ORE = new BlockBase(Material.STONE, 2.5f, 7.0f, BlockSoundGroup.STONE);

public static final ItemGroup YOURMOD_GROUP = new ItemGroupBase("yourmodid", "itemgroup", RUBY_ORE).group;

@Override
public void onInitialize() {

    RegistryHandler.registerBlockAndItem("yourmodid", "ruby_ore", RUBY_ORE, YOURMOD_GROUP);
}
```
