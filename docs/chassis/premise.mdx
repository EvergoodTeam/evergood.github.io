This documentation assumes you have a decent understanding of how to set up and work on a [Fabric Mod](https://fabricmc.net/wiki), as well as how to code in Java.

This documentation is still incomplete, so please refer to both [Compressor](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Compressor) and the example code in [Chassis](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Chassis) for functional examples, 
as well as the Javadoc present with methods.

Javadoc site integration will be added in the future.
