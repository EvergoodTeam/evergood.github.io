:::caution

As of `1.2.3`, this is outdated. Refer to [this test class](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Chassis/blob/1.19.2/src/main/java/evergoodteam/chassis/ChassisTestFeatures.java) instead for the time being.

Configs can be very useful to the player, since they can be used to customize variables and behaviours present in a mod.  
A simple example can be creating a toggle for a block being added to the game.

### Creating your configs

First we have to declare our Configs, which we can do using `ConfigBase`.

```java
public static final ConfigBase YOURMOD_CONFIGS = new ConfigBase("yourmodid");
```

Once that is done, a folder with your `modid` will be created in the game's `config` directory, and in that folder will be located all the other files necessary for both **resources** as well as the `yourmodid.properties` file.

Such a file can look something like this:

```bash
# yourmodid Configs
# Sat Jul 31 15:05:00 CET 2022

# Lock yourmodid configs from being regenerated
yourmodidConfigLocked = true
# Lock yourmodid resources from being regenerated
yourmodidResourceLocked = true
```

The first 2 properties will always be autogenerated with `ConfigBase` and are used to determine, respectively, if the config files and if the resource files are locked (no need to regenerate them on startup).

This can also be utilized by the user, especially when an unintentional edit was made to the config files.  
Simply editing the value to `false` will have those specific files be regenerated at startup and the property reset back to `true`.

### Adding properties

Using our `ConfigBase` object we can call different methods, one of which is `addProperty()`, used to add properties to both our object and the `yourmodid.properties` file.  
You can provide a comment to the property, which will appear in the config file, or simply not have one.

```java
YOURMOD_CONFIGS.addProperty("enableRubyOre", true, "Enables the Ruby Ore block")
```
```java
YOURMOD_CONFIGS.addProperty("enableRubyItem", true)
```

To register a property we have to follow it up with the method `registerProperties()`.

```java
YOURMOD_CONFIGS.addProperty("enableRubyOre", true, "Enables the Ruby Ore block").registerProperties();
```

:::tip

You can concatenate multiple `addProperty()` and have the method `registerProperties()` at the end.

```java
YOURMOD_CONFIGS.addProperty("enableRubyOre", true, "Enables the Ruby Ore block")
    .addProperty("enableRubyItem", true)
    .registerProperties();
```

:::

Now your `yourmodid.properties` file will look something like this:

```bash
# yourmodid Configs
# Sat Jul 31 15:10:00 CET 2022

# Lock yourmodid configs from being regenerated
yourmodidConfigLocked = true
# Lock yourmodid resources from being regenerated
yourmodidResourceLocked = true

# Enables the Ruby Ore block
enableRubyOre = true
enableRubyItem = true
```

### Using properties

Interacting with your `yourmodid.properties` file can be done through the `ConfigHandler` class.  
One of the available methods is `getBooleanOption()`, which returns the Boolean value of the specified property from the config file, or the default value if it isn't present.

```java
if (ConfigHandler.getBooleanOption(YOURMOD_CONFIGS, "enableRubyOre", true)){
    // Do something 
}
```

### Result

Your code should now look something like this:

```java title="MyMod.java"
public static final ConfigBase YOURMOD_CONFIGS = new ConfigBase("yourmodid");

@Override
public void onInitialize() {

    YOURMOD_CONFIGS.addProperty("enableRubyOre", true, "Enables the Ruby Ore block")
        .registerProperties();

    if (ConfigHandler.getBooleanOption(YOURMOD_CONFIGS, "enableRubyOre", true)){
        // Do something 
    }
}
```
