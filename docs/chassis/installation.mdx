Currently Chassis is only available for the **Fabric ModLoader**, so the following instructions will be focused on getting you started with your own Fabric project.
This also means that we're dependent on the [**Fabric API**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), so make sure it is included as a dependency in your project.

A port to the **Forge ModLoader** will be coming in the future.

### Requirements

- Java 17+
- [**Fabric API**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

### How our versions work

:::note

This version system could be changed in the near future

:::

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Chassis/releases) include different Builds of the project, spanning
from those in active development to final ones.

Each version name is composed of two main parts: a **version number** (`1.2.34`) and a **
suffix** (`-suffix`).

Different **suffixes** are used to highlight the nature and state of a Build:

- `-dev`: in active development, likely unstable and temporary.
- `-rc`: release candidates, in the final stages of development, next to being finalised and released officially.
- _no suffix_: final releases, can be found on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chassis) and as a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Chassis/releases).

**Version numbers** are grouped together based on Minecraft's Versions: this
means that Builds from the same group are compatible only with that specific Minecraft
Version and that they're interchangeable with one another.

The table below summarizes the supported Minecraft Versions

| Minecraft Version | `1.12.2` | `1.18.1` | `1.18.2` | `1.19.x`  |
| :---------------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-----: |
|      Support      |    🚧    |    ✔️    |    ✔️    |   ✔️    |
|  Chassis Version  |    🚧    | `1.0.x`  | `1.1.x`  | `1.2.x` |
| Fabric ModLoader  |    ❌    |    ✔️    |    ✔️    |   ✔️    |
|  Forge ModLoader  |    🚧    |    ❔    |    ❔    |   ❔    |

### `build.gradle`

In your `build.gradle`, add Chassis as a dependency using JitPack

```groovy title="build.gradle"
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

```groovy title="build.gradle"
dependencies {
    //Chassis
    modImplementation 'com.github.evergoodteam:chassis:<releaseVersion>'
}
```

Don't forget to change `<releaseVersion>` to an appropriate version, as explained **[before](#how-versions-work)**.  
We recommend using `${project.chassis_version}` and specifying the version in your `gradle.properties` for easier access

### `fabric.mod.json`

In your `fabric.mod.json`, add Chassis as a dependency

```json title="/src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json"
"depends": {
    "chassis": "1.x.x"
},
```
