With Chassis you can generate asset files (blockstates, models, lang, textures, tags) through code, without having to experience the pain of creating 5 different files for each block/item you make.

This can be done in 2 ways: 
- through a [**ResourcePack**](#creating-a-resourcepack), which has the benefit of being able to hold all sorts of assets
- through [**injection**](#injection), which is limited to only block models and recipes, but can be faster than creating a ResourcePack.

## Creating a ResourcePack

To start, you will first need to create a `ResourcePackBase` object, which will generate those assets in your config folder.  

```java
public static final ResourcePackBase YOURMOD_RESOURCES = new ResourcePackBase(YOURMOD_CONFIGS, "yourmodid");
```

This will also create a **ResourcePack**, visibile from the appropriate menu in-game. You can customize it by adding an URL with an image to use as the icon and a hex color to customize the description's color.

```java
public static final ResourcePackBase YOURMOD_RESOURCES = new ResourcePackBase(YOURMOD_CONFIGS, "yourmodid", 
    "https://evergoodteam.github.io/utils/icons/chassisIcon.png", 
    "53a074");
```

To customize the description you can add the entries listed here to your language file:

```json title="en_us.lang"
{
  "yourmodid.metadata.description": "My beatiful assets",
  "pack.source.yourmodid": "My beatiful assets"
}
```

Here is an example of how it can look in-game:

![](/img/chassisResourcePack.png)

You can hide it from the menu using the `hide()` method.

```java
YOURMOD_RESOURCES.hide();
```

### Creating assets

Through your `ResourcePackBase` object you can add assets, such as:
- Global Tags (useful for recipes)
- Blockstates
- Models
- Drop LootTables (specify what a block drops when mined)
- Required tool Tags (tool required to mine a block)
- Mining level Tags (tool tier required to mine a block)
- Textures
- Language files

You can see these options by checking out the [`ResourcePackBase` class](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Chassis/blob/1.19/src/main/java/evergoodteam/chassis/objects/resourcepacks/ResourcePackBase.java)

Here is an example from the [Chassis source code](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Chassis):
```java
CHASSIS_RESOURCES.createGlobalTag("testblock")
                .createBlockstate("testblock")
                .createBlockModels("testblock", "testblock", "all")
                .createBlockDropLootTable("testblock")
                .createRequiredToolTag("pickaxe", new String[]{"testblock"})
                .createMiningLevelTag("stone", new String[]{"testblock"})
                .createTexture(true, "https://i.imgur.com/BAStRdD.png", "testblock") // Truly a legendary URL

                .createItemModel("testitem", "testitem")
                .createTexture(false, "https://i.imgur.com/BAStRdD.png", "testitem")

                .createLang("en_us", new HashMap<>() {{
                    put("block.chassis.testblock", "Test Block");
                    put("item.chassis.testitem", "Test Item");
                    put("itemGroup.chassis.testgroup", "Test Group");
                }});
```

### Result

Your code should now look something like this:

```java title="MyMod.java"
public static final ResourcePackBase YOURMOD_RESOURCES = new ResourcePackBase(YOURMOD_CONFIGS, "yourmodid");

@Override
public void onInitialize() {

    YOURMOD_RESOURCES.createGlobalTag("rubyblock")
        .createBlockstate("rubyblock")
        .createBlockModels("rubyblock", "rubyblock", "all");
}
```

## Injection

Injection is done through the `InjectionHandler` class and the methods it provides.  
You may use it in conjunction with a **ResourcePack** that doesn't worry about models and recipes.

### Block models

To have all the blocks from your mod supplied with block models, you can use the `addModelInjection()` method.

```java
InjectionHandler.addModelInjection("yourmodid");
```

If you want a block to behave like a column texture-wise (see Basalt), you can specify the type with the method `InjectionHandler.addColumnType()`.

```java
InjectionHandler.addColumnType("basalt");
```

### Recipes

Adding a recipe first requires a `JsonObject`, which contains all the information needed in the json format.  
You can create a recipe json through the `RecipeJson` class, which provides methods for shaped and shapeless recipes, as well as 3x3 and ring shapes.

To now create the recipe we can use the `addRecipe()` method:

```java
InjectionHandler.addRecipe("yourmodid", "rubyblock", 
    RecipeJson.create3x3RecipeJson("item", 
        new Identifier("yourmodid", "ruby"), 
        new Identifier("yourmodid", "rubyblock"), 
    1));
```

### Result

Your code should now look something like this:

```java title="MyMod.java"
@Override
public void onInitialize() {

    InjectionHandler.addColumnType("basalt");
    InjectionHandler.addModelInjection("yourmodid");
    
    InjectionHandler.addRecipe("yourmodid", "rubyblock", RecipeJson.create3x3RecipeJson("item", new Identifier("yourmodid", "ruby"), new Identifier("yourmodid", "rubyblock"), 1));
}
```
