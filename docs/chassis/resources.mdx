With Chassis you can generate asset files (blockstates, models, lang, textures, tags) through code, without having to experience the pain of creating 5 different files for each block/item you make.

To start, you will first need to create a `ResourcePackBase` object, which will generate those assets in your config folder.  

```java
public static final ResourcePackBase YOURMOD_RESOURCES = new ResourcePackBase(YOURMOD_CONFIGS, "yourmodid");
```

This will also create a **ResourcePack**, visibile from the appropriate menu in-game. You can customize it by adding an URL with an image to use as the icon and a hex color to customize the text description color.

```java
public static final ResourcePackBase YOURMOD_RESOURCES = new ResourcePackBase(YOURMOD_CONFIGS, "yourmodid", 
    "https://evergoodteam.github.io/utils/icons/chassisIcon.png", 
    "53a074");
```

To customize the description you can add the entries listed here to your language file:

```json title="en_us.lang"
{
  "yourmodid.metadata.description": "My beatiful assets",
  "pack.source.yourmodid": "My beatiful assets"
}
```
