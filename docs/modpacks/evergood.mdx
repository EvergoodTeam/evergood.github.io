## üìë Description {#description}

Evergood is a 1.12.2 Minecraft Modpack running on the Forge ModLoader. It's the first Project that we've worked on and is still in development.

The final objective with this modpack is creating an everlasting and fresh experience, where the player is challenged with complex recipes and adventures in a beatiful and unexplored landscape, all while pointing towards the automation of absolutely everything.

:::caution

The modpack is in the early/mid stages of development, so do not expect fully fledged out features and stability. Remember that everything is subject to change.

The project files are flagged as Releases for visibility on the [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/evergood) app and site, but the Modpack is to be considered in ~Alpha.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Specs {#specs}

We recommend allocating `6GB` of RAM to play this modpack. A lower amount will only result in slower loading times / performance or in the modpack not loading at all.  

The modpack already includes many mods oriented towards performance, but if you're still experiencing issues you can try using Optifine, even if many mods do not recommend it.
