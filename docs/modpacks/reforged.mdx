## üìë Description {#description}

Evergood Reforged reimagines its [1.12.2 counterpart](./evergood.mdx) in the newer versions of Minecraft, starting from 1.18.

This means more Quests, more intricated Recipes and more beatiful Landscapes, all accompanied by new and returning Mods.

You can find more about it on its [Curseforge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/evergoodreforged)

:::caution

The modpack is in the early stages of development, so do not expect fully fledged out features and stability. Remember that everything is subject to change.

The modpack runs on 1.18+, meaning that bugs are unavoidable and features are missing.

Old and new Mods will be added as soon as they are ported to this version.

The project files are flagged as Releases for visibility on the [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/evergoodreforged) app and site.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Specs {#specs}

We recommend allocating `6GB` of RAM to play this modpack. A lower amount will only result in slower loading times / performance or in the modpack not loading at all.  

The modpack already includes many mods oriented towards performance, but if you're still experiencing issues you can try using Optifine, even if many mods do not recommend it.
