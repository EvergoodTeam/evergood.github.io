# Supporting the Evergood Projects

There are many different ways you can show support for the Evergood Projects: even just playing with our creations is more than enough! You shouldn't feel any sort of obligation towards us, so feel free to simply enjoy them and have a great time.  

If you do want to show greater support and help continue development, here are listed some options.

### BisectHosting

A very direct way to show support for the Projects is making a purchase over at [**BisectHosting**](https://bisecthosting.com/Libra) using our promotional code, **`Libra`**, to get a 25% discount on your order!

### Joining the community

You can join the community over at our [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/k2P68Y8), where you can discuss Projects currently in development, be notified on news about upcoming updates, receive support on any kind of issue you're having or help with development.
