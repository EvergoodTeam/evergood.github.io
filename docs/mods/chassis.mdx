## üìë Description {#description}

Chassis is a Library providing utilities for dynamic asset generation (Blockstates, Models, Tags, Recipes, Loot Tables, Textures) and simple configuration.

A showcase of the available features can be found (commented) in the source code or in [**Compressor**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compressor).

## Adding to your own project

### How versions work

:::note

This system could be changed in the near future

:::

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/EvergoodTeam/Chassis/releases) include different Builds of the project, spanning
from those in active development to final ones.

Each version name is composed of two main parts: a <ins>version number</ins> (`1.2.34`) and a <ins>
suffix</ins> (`-suffix`).

Different <ins>suffixes</ins> are used to highlight the nature and state of a Build:

- `-dev`: in active development, likely unstable and temporary
- `-pre`: in the final stages of development, next to being finalised and released officially
- *no suffix*: final releases, can be found on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chassis)

<ins>Version numbers</ins> are grouped together based on Minecraft's Versions:  
this means that Builds from the same group are compatible only with that specific Minecraft Version and that they're
interchangeable with one another.

The table below summarizes the supported Minecraft Versions

| Minecraft Version | `1.12.2` | `1.18.1` | `1.18.2` | `1.19`  |
|:-----------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|
|      Support      |    üöß     |    ‚úîÔ∏è    |    ‚úîÔ∏è    |   ‚úîÔ∏è    |
|  Chassis Version  |    ?     | `1.0.x`  | `1.1.x`  | `1.2.x` |


### `build.grade`

In your `build.grade`, add the Project as a dependency

```groovy title="build.gradle"
repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

```groovy title="build.gradle"
dependencies {
    ...
    //Chassis
    modImplementation 'com.github.evergoodteam:chassis:<releaseVersion>'
}
```

Don't forget to change `<releaseVersion>` to an appropriate version, as explained **[before](#how-versions-work)**  
We recommend using `${project.chassis_version}` and specifying the version in your `gradle.properties` for easier access

### `fabric.mod.json`

In your `fabric.mod.json`, add the Project as a dependency

```json title="/src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json"
"depends": {
    ...
    "chassis": "1.x.x"
},
```
